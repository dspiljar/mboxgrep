Changes of mboxgrep
===================

Changes since 0.7.8
- implemented support for mbox folders compressed with bzip2 algorithm
- improved detection of PCRE library; this also fixes a compilation bug
  on recent RedHat Linux systems
- fixed a problem with message deletion, which used to occur if an mbox
  folder and temporary directory were on different filesystems;
  thanks to James P. Dugal <jpd@louisiana.edu> for providing a patch

Changes since 0.7.7
- fixed crashes on MH folders, as well as a potential problem with mbox
  and maildir folders with the same cause
- debugging with dmalloc library
- MH and maildir functions no longer read files which aren't RFC 2822 messages
- mboxgrep can now read gzip compressed mbox folders from standard input
  (which is a side effect of a code cleanup!)

Changes since 0.7.6a
- mboxgrep can now read mbox folders from standard input

Changes since 0.7.6
- fixed a bug which prevented mboxgrep from being compiled

Changes since 0.7.5
- fixed a bug which caused mboxgrep to coredump on recursive search of 
  maildirs
- code cleanups

Changes since 0.7.4
- recursive search through directories has been reimplemented

Changes since 0.7.3
- mboxgrep can now ignore messages with identical bodies

Changes since 0.7.2
- file locking method can be selected at runtime
- mboxgrep used to coredump on messages with empty headers; the problem is 
  now hopefully fixed
- mboxgrep now compiles on FreeBSD

Changes since 0.7.1
- file locking with flock() instead of fcntl() is now supported
- mboxgrep should now compile on systems which don't have getopt_long()
- other minor bugfixes

Changes since 0.7.0
- bugfixes

Changes since 0.5.3
- NOTE: there was no stable version between 0.5.x and 0.7.x
- mboxgrep is almost completely rewritten
- implemented message deleting feature (--delete)
- implemented piping messages to a command (--pipe) (using this option, 
  each selected message is piped to a separate instance of the specified
  command)
- added support for compressed mbox folders

Changes since 0.5.2
- implemented ability to write found messages to another folder (instead
  of stdout)
- started writing *real* changelog (while this file has been renamed to
  "NEWS")
- wrote a manual in Texinfo format

Changes since 0.5.1
- implemented message counting (-c, --count)
- fixed manual page installation target in src/Makefile.in -- manual page 
  is now installed in $(manpath)/man1/ rather than in $(prefix)/man/man1/ 
- added `--without-sense-of-humor' switch to the configure script, which
  disables checking whether Garfield still hates Mondays
- short version of `--version' switch is now `-V' instead of `-v', 
  because `-v' will be used for inverted matching
- implemented inverted matching (-v, --invert-match)
- implemented recursive search through directories (-r, --recursive)
- config.h[.in] is now wrapped (#ifndef CONFIG_H and stuff)

Changes since 0.5.0
- added support for qmail-style maildir folders

Changes since 0.4.0
- source of getopt_long() is now included, so long options are also available
  on platforms that don't use GNU libc
- file locking is now performed on mbox folders only

Changes since 0.2.0
- added support for MH mailboxes
- added scope selection switches `-B' (or `--body') and `-H' (or `--headers')
- getopt() (or getopt_long(), if available) is now used to parse command line
  arguments, instead of my own lousy routine
- configure script now looks for PCRE by default, unless `--with-pcre=no' or
  `--without-pcre' is specified
- the feature of reading from standard input is gone
- added `-v' (or `--version') switch

Changes since 0.1.1
- mboxgrep now puts a shared lock on a mailbox before reading it
- various code cleanups

Changes since 0.1.0
- fixed install target in Makefile (`install' is now used instead of `cp')
- added support for mailboxes generated by Gnus
