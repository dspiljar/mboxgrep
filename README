mboxgrep - displays e-mail messages matching a pattern

Full description of mboxgrep is contained in the documentation,
which is provided both in manpage and texinfo format, to satisfy
believers of both religions.

The author of mboxgrep is Daniel Spiljar, who can be reached via email
at <dspiljar@world.std.com>.  Bug reports, feature requests and flames
are welcome.

If you intend to bundle mboxgrep with an operating system (such as a
GNU/Linux distrubution, for example), please drop me a line about it.

For build instructions, read the file `INSTALL', and run 
`./configure --help'
